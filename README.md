### Transforming the Tech Landscape: Empowering Businesses, Driving Digital Innovation, and Championing Open Source

With 17+ years of experience leading and implementing cutting-edge digital projects in the Food & Beverage, FMCG, and mobile industries, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and strategic thinking. As a former Executive Digital Producer at Ogilvy Worldwide, one of the largest global digital marketing agencies, I have spearheaded major projects, developed smart systems, and delivered CMMI level 5 compliant solutions for prominent Japanese automobile clients.

My involvement spans diverse domains, including enterprise eCommerce, ERP, SaaS/Cloud Computing/IaaS/PaaS (Salesforce), Microsite, native/hybrid mobile applications, 2D-3D-Realtime games/applications, Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Notably, I am the founder of two open-source content management systems: Vontigo (https://vontigo.org), a CMS integrated with AI, and Mixcore CMS (https://mixcore.org). These projects showcase my technical prowess, creative thinking, and entrepreneurial spirit. Moreover, I excel in Customer Experience (CX), User Experience (UX), and User Interface (UI), and possess expertise in various technical stacks, including architectures, cloud services, microservices, DevOps, and CI/CD.

I am dedicated to driving digital innovation, enabling businesses to thrive in the digital age, and fostering collaboration through open-source initiatives. Together, let's shape the future, empower tech, and embrace the possibilities of the digital world.
